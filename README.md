# iCloud Tabs Reader

A very simple Python class to get the current list of iCloud Tabs known to your Mac. Run `python listicloudtabs.py` to print the tab list in `title <url> (device)` format. The list does not update instantaneously as you browse, but usually seems to catch up within a few seconds.
